Science Program Mini-Model
<p>
These classes provide a minimal immutable representation of relevant objects from spModel,
allowing us to take a small but complete (in terms of QPT) snapshot of a running database
and then deal with it efficiently.
<p>
These classes are created in the ObsQueryFunctor and returned from the server; thus, they 
must be Serializable.
