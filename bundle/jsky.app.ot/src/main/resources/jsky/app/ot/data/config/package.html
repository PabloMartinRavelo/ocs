Configuration builder support (Used to represent observing sequences, iterators, and their parameters).
Configurations come into play during observation execution time
and are used by Observation Executors and Principle System Agents.
Configurations describe a desired state of the system and are composed
in a hierarchy.  In particular, an

<code>{@link jsky.app.ot.data.config.IConfig}</code>

(<i>configuration</i>) instance is made up of one or more <i>system
configuration</i> instances (

<code>{@link jsky.app.ot.data.config.ISysConfig}</code>

).  Each
system configuration is destined for a particular system (say an instrument
or telescope control system).  The system configuration, in turn, is
composed of one or more

<code>{@link jsky.app.ot.data.config.IParameter}</code>

instances.
<i>Parameter</i>s describe the desired state of a single controllable
entity.  They are the atomic units in the hierarchy.

<p>Additionally, an interface (

<code>{@link jsky.app.ot.nsp.model.config.IConfigBuilder}</code>

) is provided to allow clients such as
the Observation Executor to step through the configurations that can be
produced by a science program node.  An instance of an object implementing
this interface is associated with the program node as a "user" object.
(See <code>{@link edu.gemini.pot.sp.ISPRemoteNode}</code>.)  The interface
provides <code>Iterator</code>-like methods for stepping through the
available configurations.
