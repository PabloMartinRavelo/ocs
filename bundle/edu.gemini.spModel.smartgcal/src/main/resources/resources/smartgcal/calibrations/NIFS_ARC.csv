#,"For a daytime Calibration set at each wavelength, take: 1) Lamps on flats, 2) Lamps off flats, 3) Ar arcc dAr arcks, 4) Ronchi calibration masks, 5) CleAr arc Ar arcray frame (CleAr arc Ar arcray is to get rid of image persistence from the Ronchi mask frames).  NOTE: Observations Ar arce defined in that order to minimize the number of FPU moves in NIFS and increase the efficiency.",,,,,,,,,,,
#,Ar arccs for NIFS observations should ALWAYS be taken with the science at night!  (not as daytime calibs).,,,,,,,,,,,
#,"The Filter and Central Wavelength should be matched to the science observations, as these can be customized by the PI.",,,,,,,,,,,
#,"If the science observation is made with an occullting disk, this should also be used for the flat fields. This is an uncommon mode.",,,,,,,,,,,
#,PAr arcameters that should be matched to the science Ar arce indicated in dAr arck orange:,,,,,,,,,,,
