This package defines the Science Program Database Service.  The
Science Program lifecycle is controlled by this service.  It is used to
create new programs, fetch existing programs, and query programs.
<p>
Clients are most concerned with the
<code>{@link edu.gemini.pot.spdb.IDBDatabase}</code> interface.  The
database service proxy implements this interface, as does the local
<code>{@link edu.gemini.pot.spdb.DBDatabase}</code> implementation object.
Clients are programmed to look for this interface in the lookup service,
and use it for creating/fetching Science Programs.
