A collection of classes used to obtain the entire state of an observation in
objects local to the client.  In other words, it collects the data objects
along with all the remote nodes so that multiple trips to the database
are not required to obtain all information relevant to an observation.

<p>
See {@link edu.gemini.spModel.ext.ObservationNode} for the top-level
    observation information, and
    {@link edu.gemini.spModel.ext.ObservationNodeFunctor} for the functor used
    to obtain it from the database.
