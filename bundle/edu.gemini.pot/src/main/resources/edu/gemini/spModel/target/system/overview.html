This package provides classes to represent celestial coordinate
systems.  It supports systems that have a time and arc coordinate,
two arc-based coordinates, or a position specified with orbital
elements.

<p>The goal is to evolve these classes into something that will
be of general use to a wider group of programmers under the JSky
umbrella.
