    affiliated country until a single NGO is assigned at Phase 2.  Each submitted partner has a requested
    time and a minimum time.
    NOTE: The partnerReferenceNumber has been added to the partnerSubmission to allow NGOs to submit
          all the information needed at upload without creating new elements in the proposal.
    NOTE: the submissionFlag and submissionStatus are information used by PIT to track the location of a
          joing proposal and the success or failure of a specific submission.
