/**
 * Data binding support. An object of type Bound[A,M] is bound to a value of type A, focused down to a value of type
 * M ("model") via a provided Lens. This allows each UI component to handle a particular small part of the Proposal,
 * without worrying about the rest of it. External changes are pushed down, and local changes are pushed up. This is
 * how the PIT UI works.
 *
 * The model (the value you're watching and perhaps changing) is available via the read/write property 'model', of type
 * Option[M]. Writing this property causes the new value to be pushed up through the lens to the top-level binding
 * provider (in our case a BoundView, which ultimately pushes model changes up to the Shell).
 *
 * External changes will similarly be pushed down into bound objects. This event can be detected, if desired, by
 * overriding refresh(m:Option[M]):Unit.
 *
 * An object of type Bound[_,M] can have a list of child objects of type Bound[M,_], declared by overriding 'children'.
 * This is how you hook up a tree of components and sub-components. The mechanics of pushing model changes to children
 * is provided for free.
