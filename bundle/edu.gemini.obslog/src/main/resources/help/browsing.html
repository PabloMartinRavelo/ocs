<h2>Browsing the Database using the Observing Log Web Application</h2>


<h3>The Observing Log application provides three different views of completed observations</h3>

<ul>
<li>The Plan View is the view of observations taken on a single night in the order they are acquired.  In Plan View
there is one line for each <em>unique configuration</em> of the instrument used to acquire data.
</li>
<li>Observation View is the view of a single observation showing all the observation's datasets.  The configuration
of the system for each dataset is completely shown.
</li>
<li>Program View shows all the observations in a Science Program.  As with Plan View, the observations are shown as
one line for each <em>unique configuration</em>.
