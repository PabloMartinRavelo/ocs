<h2>How Things Work Briefly</h2>

<p>The Observing Database has been augmented with Plan documents.  There is one Plan document for each observing night.
An observing night runs from 2pm to 2pm local time at each site.
</p>
<p>Part of a Plan document is the Observing Log data.
</p>

<h3>What is in the Observing Log in the Observing Database</h3>
<ul>
<li>The weather data consists of 30 minute averages of several parameters.  These values are collected every 2 hours
from 2pm in the afternoon until 8am the following morning and stored in the Plan document.
</li>
<li>Whenever the seqexec starts a sequence, the observation ID is entered into a list that is kept in the Plan document.
This list of observations is used to construct the Observing Log Plan View.
</li>
<li>Information about observers is kept in the Plan document.
