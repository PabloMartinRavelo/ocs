<h2>Comments can be added in two ways.</h2>

<h3>Adding Comments with the Observing Tool</h3>
<ul>
<li>Comments can be added with the Observing Tool by locating the observation and adding comments to the Observing Log
Component.
</li>
<li>The comments in the Observing Log component are dataset comments.  The comment that shows up in the normal
Plan view is the dataset comment for the first dataset comment in a configuration of the instrument.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Adding Comments from the Web Application</h3>
<ul>
<li>Comments can also be added from the web application using the browser interface.
</li>
<li>In the Plan View, Observation View, or Program View a comment will be the shown right most column.
</li>
<li>The first column has the Actions.  One action is a link named comment.  Type the comment into the comment column
and select the comment link.  This will update the database without redrawing the
web page.  I'm working on a way to make the action of saving more obvious.
</li>
</ul>
