<h2>Using the Observing Log during Observing</h2>

<ul>
<li>Once the Plan View for a specific night is opened, as observing progresses the refresh button on the browser
will update the plan for the most recent observation.
</li>
<li>At this time the current observation is <em>not</em> shown until some data has been successfully acquired and the
Observing Log component is present in the observation.  This
will change in a subsequent version to allow comments for observations that are underway but have no data.
</li>
</ul>
