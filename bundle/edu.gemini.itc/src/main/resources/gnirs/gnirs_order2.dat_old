# Average throughput for the GNIRS Order 2 filter
# Columns are (1) wavelength in nm, (2) throughput
# No transmission curve available.
# Values from J. Elias sensitivity table (July 2003)
# Used Jay's value at the central wavelength and 50% filter edges
# and assumed drop from peak to zero over ~200nm (similar
# to order 1)
