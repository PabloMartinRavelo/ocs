# This represents transmission of the optics of NICI.

# Only information available at this time is telescope+AO system
# transmission is about 82% at around 1600 nm.
#
# Telescope tranmission is something like 98%, so guessing transmission
# value of AO system is ~84%.  Tranmission of cold mirrors 0.94%
# Total tranmission = 0.84*0.94=0.7896.  Guessing 0.78 to be on safe side
#
#
# From new info from MK IR, setting this to 0.768 for AO+cold optics 2-25-09
