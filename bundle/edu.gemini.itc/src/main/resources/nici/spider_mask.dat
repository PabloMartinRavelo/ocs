# Accounts for the reduction in flux due to NICI's spider mask, which
# is slightly larger than the telescope central obstruction.
#
# The mask reduces the telescope pupil area by ~2.25 m^2 over the central
# obstruction.  This coordesponds to about 4.58%.  This file will uniformly 
# reduce an SED's flux by that amount.
