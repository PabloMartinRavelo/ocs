QPT Model Classes
<p>
The Schedule is the root object of the QPT model. The schedule owns an SP Mini-Model, which is an 
in-memory, immutable representation of the state of the SPDB. The following invariants apply:
<ul>
<li>A schedule's mini-model may change, but may never be null.
<li>When the mini-model changes, allocs can become invalid for several reasons:
	<ul>
		<li>The associated obs has been deleted, or all steps have been executed. 
		    In this case the alloc must also be deleted.
		<li>The associated obs steps have been partially executed. In this case the step
		    boundaries must be adjusted.
		<li>In all cases, alloc durations must be re-calculated if the alloc is not
		    deleted.
	</ul>
	Each variant is responsible for repairing these problems when it sees the mini-model
	change, and must preserve the validity of all allocs during this process; the 
	variant must manage the update and repair process such that, for example, the UI can
	repaint a partially-repaired variant without errors. A local obsId to Obs cache map
	is a possible solution.
</ul>
