Blueprints : GNIRS_BP.xml
Version : 2012 August 10, Marie L-B and Bryan M
Version : 2013 October 10, AStephens, set well depth and offsets for >2.5 microns and central wavelength for imaging
Version : 2014 December 11, BMiller, specific setting conditions from PI (change to add science conditions to tellurics)
Version : 2017-Oct-10, astephens, change long-slit science offsets from +/-3 to -1/+5 and add re-acquisition observation

                The GNIRS filters are changing in the 12B OT (see

                J (1.25um) => J-MK: 1.25um
                H (1.65um) => order 4 (H-MK)
                K (2.20um) => K-MK: 2.20um
                H2 (2.122um) => H2: 2.12um
