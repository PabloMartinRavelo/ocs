### IMAGING MODE

If CAMERA == F/6
   INCLUDE {1,2,3,4} IN target-specific Scheduling Group
   SCI={1},{2}
   STD={3}
   DAY={4}

IF CAMERA == F/14

# AO Mode
# In NGS mode target and standards use the same Altair guide mode.
# In LGS mode the target uses the mode from PI, standards use NGS+FieldsLens
# Altair components must not be added to the DAY observations
IF AO mode != None AND NOT DAY ({4}, {8}, {13})
    ADD Altair Adaptive Optics component AND 
    SET Guide Star Type based on:
      IF AO in PI includes "Natural Guide Star" (NGS mode) THEN SET
      for ALL in the group:
        AO=Altair Natural Guidestar => Natural Guide Star
        AO=Altair Natural Guidestar w/ Field Lens => Laser Guide Star
	with Field Lens
      IF AO in PI includes "Laser Guide Star" (LGS mode) THEN SET for
      ACQ and SCI:
          AO=Altair Laser Guidestar => Laser Guide Star + AOWFS
          AO=Altair Laser Guidestar w/ PWFS1 => Laser Guide Star + PWFS1
        AND SET for STD:
          SET Guide Star Type=Natural Guide Star with Field Lens

# Filters
FOR SCI, STD, OBSERVATIONS:
SET FILTERS(S) from Phase-I in top-level (first) NIRI iterator.

FOR DAY OBSERVATIONS:
IF WAVE(FILTER) < 3um, SET FILTERS(S) from Phase-I in top-level
(first) NIRI iterator. 
#In DAY observations the any iterators containing the Dark exposure must not
iterate over filters.

FOR ACQ OBSERVATIONS:
SET first FILTER from Phase-I in NIRI static component.

# Exposure times and coadds
FOR SCI observations:
SET EXPOSURE TIME and COADDS in Iterator/Static component from
spreadsheet NIRI_exptimes.xls.

FOR STD and ACQ, DON'T set EXPOSURE TIME, it will be taken from the template.

# Dark exposures
IN DAY OBSERVATIONS:
FOR EACH UNIQUE COMBINATION OF EXPOSURE TIME AND COADD in SCI, create
a NIRI Sequence with a Manual Dark beneath. The NUMBER of observes,
EXPOSURE TIME, and COADDs are set in the Dark component. The READ MODE
is set in the iterator, see below, based on the exposure time. The
NUMBER of observes is always 10 (10X). One iterator is present in the 
BP libraries, more may be added.

# Dark example
# JHK f/6 imaging
# J: 60sec, 1 coadd => Read Mode = Low Background (1-2.5um: Faint Object...)
# H: 15sec, 4 coadds => Read Mode = Medium Background (1-2.5um: JHK and ...)
# K: 30sec, 2 coadds => Read Mode = Medium Background (3-5um: Imaging/Spect...)
# 
# In the calibration observation created from {4} the sequence is
# NIRI Flats
#   Filter
#      J
#      H
#      K
#      - Flat
# NIRI sequence
#    Read mode
#      1-2.5um: Faint Object Narrow-band Imaging/Spectroscopy
#      - Manual Dark (10x observe, 60 sec, 1 coadds)
# NIRI sequence
#    Read mode
#      1-2.5um: JHK and Bright Object Narrow-band Imaging/Spectroscopy
#      - Manual Dark (10x observe, 15 sec, 4 coadds)
#      - Manual Dark (10x observe, 30 sec, 2 coadds)
  

# Read Mode
IN ALL ITERATORS AND STATIC COMPONENTS EXCEPT the FLATS sequences in
DAY observations:
IF Exptime >= 45s:   SET  Read Mode = Low Background (1-2.5um: Faint Object...)
ELSEIF Exptime >= 1.0s:  SET Read Mode = Medium Background (1-2.5um:
JHK and Bright Object...)
ELSE:                 SET Read Mode = High Background (3-5um: Imaging/Spectroscopy)

# Well depth
IF WAVE (see NIRI_exptimes.xls) > 3micron (equally FILTER(S) includes H20
Ice, hydrocarbon, L(prime), Br(alpha) cont, Br(alpha), M(prime)): SET
Deep well (3-5 um)
ELSE SET Shallow Well (1-2.5 um)  (default)

# DO NOT ADD 'OVERVIEW' NOTE UNTIL WE CAN PUT IT AT THE TOP-LEVEL
#Top-level note 'OVERVIEW' should be included in all programs

Note: on instantiation, do not add a target component to the STD observation.
