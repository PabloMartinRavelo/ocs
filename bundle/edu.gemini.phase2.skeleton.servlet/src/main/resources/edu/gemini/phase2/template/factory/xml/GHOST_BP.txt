# DEFINITIONS

**** IF INSTRUMENT MODE == SPECTROSCOPY ***

INCLUDE {1}     # Science

SET RESOLUTION MODE FROM PI

SET TARGET MODE FROM PI

ON TEMPATE INSTANTIATION (adding the target(s))
	IF RESOLUTION MODE == STANDARD
	    IF TARGET MODE == 'Single'
	    	Add target from PI to SRIFU1

	    IF TARGET MODE == 'Dual'  # Position from PI is the fainter target
	    	Add target from PI to SRIFU1
	    	Add target from PI with RA - 2 arcmin to SRIFU2, set target name to 'Target 2'

		IF TARGET MODE ==  'SRIFU + Sky'
			Add target from PI to SRIFU1
			Add target from PI with ra - 2 arcmin to SRIFU2, set target name to 'Sky'

	IF RESOLUTION MODE == HIGH or PRECISION RADIAL VELOCITY
		Add target from PI to HRIFU
		Add target from PI with ra - 2 arcmin to HRSKY, the target name should be 'Sky'
