INCLUDE {1}     # Science

ON TEMPATE INSTANTIATION (adding the target(s))
	IF RESOLUTION MODE == STANDARD
	    IF TARGET MODE == 'Single'
	    	Add target from PI to SRIFU1
	    IF TARGET MODE == 'Dual'  # Position from PI is the Base position
	    	Add target1 from PI with RA + 1 arcmin to SRIFU1

		IF TARGET MODE ==  'SRIFU1 Sky + SRIFU2 Target'
			Add target from PI to SRIFU2
			Add target from PI with ra + 2 arcmin to SRIFU1
		ELSE
			Add target from PI to SRIFU1
			IF TARGET MODE ==  'SRIFU1 Target + SRIFU2 Sky'
				Add target from PI with ra - 2 arcmin to SRIFU2

	IF RESOLUTION MODE == HIGH or PRECISION RADIAL VELOCITY
		Add target from PI to HRIFU
		Add target from PI with ra - 2 arcmin to HRSKY
