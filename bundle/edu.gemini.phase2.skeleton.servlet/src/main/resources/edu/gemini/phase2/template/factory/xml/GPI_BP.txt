# Change Note FR: Merged ARC into Acquisition for ALL Y, J and H PRISM
# ARC {4} now is fixed to H-direct and ONLY used for K-band (but fixed to H)
# Updated Next libID=9 (from 8)

Observations are identified by library IDs, indicated with {}

PI = Phase I
{} = Library ID

IF DISPERSER == PRISM:
  IF FILTER == {Y or J or H}:  # No sky required
     INCLUDE {8} {2}
  IF FILTER == {K1 or K2}:     # Sky required
    INCLUDE {1} {3} {4}

ELSE IF DISPERSER == WOLLASTON:
  IF FILTER == {Y or J or H}: # No sky required
    INCLUDE {5} {6}
  IF FILTER == {K1 or K2}:    # Sky required
    INCLUDE {5} {7}

SET OBSERVING MODE FROM PI for all observations EXCEPT {4} (H Direct) which should NOT change. 

# {4} has a fixed Observing Mode (H Direct) and this should NOT change.
