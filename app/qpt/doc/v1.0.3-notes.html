<h1>QPT 1.0.3 Release Notes</h1>

QPT release 1.0.3 addresses 18 issues, described below. 
Release notes for the previous release are available <a href="v1.0.2-notes.html">here</a>. 

<p>
<i style="color: green">
This is a somewhat half-baked release because we had some unexpected database work
that took our attention away from QPT for most of the semester. You will see a few
new features and should notice that the UI is generally smoother, and you will see 
half-complete features that hint at things to
come. For instance, you can select multiple visits in the plan visualizer, but
can't drag them (yet). You can also open a plan directly from the web, but you 
cannot specify a template that way (yet). There should be a follow-on release 
early in 07A to complete these features.
</p>
<p>
This is a major update that will require you to re-install the entire QPT application
including the application launcher, so please read the instructions below! If you 
have never installed QPT, please see <a href="install.html"><i>Running QPT</i></a>.
</p>

</i>

<h2>Upgrading to QPT 1.0.3</h2>

<h3>Step 1. Update the OSGi Launcher.</h3>

First you need to update the OSGi application launcher. These instructions assume
that you had previously installed <code>launcher.jar</code> in <code>~/.ocs</code>:

<pre>
$ cd ~/.ocs
$ rm launcher.jar
$ curl -O http://sbfmaps.cl.gemini.edu:9999/runtime/launcher/launcher.jar
...
$ cd
</pre>
If you don't have <code>curl</code>, use your web browser or <code>wget</code>:
<pre>
$ wget http://sbfmaps.cl.gemini.edu:9999/runtime/launcher/launcher.jar
</pre>

<h3>Step 2 - Uninstall and Re-install the QPT application.</h3>

<!--You should do this <i>or</i> Option 2 below.-->

<pre>
$ launcher -a:qpt -u
$ launcher -h:sbfmaps.cl.gemini.edu -i:qpt -v
</pre>
You are now upgraded and can start QPT via
<pre>
$ launcher -a:qpt
</pre>

<!--
<h3>Step 2 - Option 2: Install QPT while retaining the old version.</h3>

<i>You should do this <b>or</b> Option 1 above.</i>
To install the new version while retaining the previous version, you can provide an 
alias for the new version and use the alias to launch.

<pre>
$ launcher -h:sbfmaps.cl.gemini.edu -i:qpt -v <span style="color:red">-a:qpt-1.0.3</span>
</pre>
You are now upgraded and can start QPT via
<pre>
$ launcher <span style="color:red">-a:qpt-1.0.3</span>
</pre>
--> 

As always, please direct questions and comments to <code>rnorris@gemini.edu</code> and cc: the QC groups if
appropriate.

<h2>New and Notable</h2>

<h3>[IN PROGRESS: QPT-50, 84] Enhanced Selection Handling</h3>
The user interface's handling of selected objects had been greatly improved and is
now more consistent and predictable. Basically, when you click on something, all related
objects in other views will be selected, including multiple selections when
appropriate. For example, if you click on a candidate observation with mutiple split
visits scheduled, all visits will be selected in the Visits view and in the
visualizer. Problem marker selection seems to work intuitively now.

The Properties view has been enhanced to support this as well; if multiple objects are 
selected, the properties view will show the properties these objects have in common. 
This remains work in progress, but hopefully you will find that the UI feels more
solid.

<h3>[IN PROGRESS: QPT-40, 159] GQPT Weighting</h3>
A preliminary weighting algorithm has been added. It appears as a new column called 
"Score" in the Candidate Observations list. The scores themselves are meaningful 
only in the sense that a higher number reflects a higher scheduling score based 
on the candidate's flags and priority; a score of 3000 <i>does not</i> mean that the
observation is twice as important as one with a score of 1500.
<p>
You can sort on this column if you want to experiment with this scoring system,
or simply <i>ignore this column if it's not useful</i>, and send me an email if
you have a specific complaint. This is very much work in progress.

<h3>[IN PROGRESS: QPT-157] New Candidate Observation Flags</h3>
Candidate observations are now annotated with the following additional flags. These
were intended mostly for use by the automatic plan filling algorithm, but may be
useful for queue coordinators as well. They appear in the Properties view but do not
affect the candidates' visual appearance in the Candidate Observations view.
<ul>
<li><code>SETS_EARLY</code> indicates that the target sets within the first three
hours of the night. This flag is an intrinsic property of the plan and will be the
same for all variants.
<li><code>PARTIAL</code> indicates that the target is <i>partially</i> blocked;
i.e., there is not enough time left in the current variant to schedule all remaining
steps, but there is at least enough time available for setup + step 1. This flag
will likely change from variant to variant.
</ul>

<h3>[QPT-118, 119] Cloning and Re-Ordering of Variants</h3>
The Variants view now has additional toolbar buttons to allow the user to clone
and re-order variants. Cloning a variant will add an identical copy called "Copy of
..." to the list (note that you may need to scroll down to see it). The up and
down arrows allow you to re-order variants.

<h3>[QPT-121, 170] PI Priority and Science Band in Candidate List</h3>
The Candidate Observation view now has a new column called <i>P</i> for PI Priority,
with single-letter values <code>L</code>, <code>M</code>, <code>H</code>, and 
<code>T</code> (for Low, Medium, High, and ToO). There is also an "SB" column
for Science Band, which is from 1 through 4 (with 4 being the bad weather queue).


<h3>Other Minor and Self-Explanatory Changes</h3>

<ul>
<li>[QPT-192] Target names in plan document are now truncated with elipsis at 20 characters.
<li>[QPT-191] Problem markers are now filtered by the current variant.
<li>[QPT-165] Elevation warning/error are now at 80&deg; and 85&deg;
<li>[QPT-156] 	 An elevation of > 85&deg; is no longer considered a hard constraint
violation when calculating schedulability.
<li>[QPT-158] 	 Fix functor/model versioning problem. This was an internal issue
related to the Update Software command.		
<li>[QPT-154] 	 Published plan now uses unambiguous language in its title. "Night 
of July 15 &rarr; 16", for example.
<li>[QPT-153] 	 QPT now remember your site. Whenever you create a new plan, QPT will
default to the last site you used.		
<li>[QPT-155] 	 Browser title bar now contains the UTC date.
<li>[QPT-49] 	 Visits grabbed off-center no longer jump when you begin dragging.
</ul>
