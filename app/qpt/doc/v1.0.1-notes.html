<h1>QPT 1.0.1 Release Notes</h1>

QPT release 1.0.1 addresses 31 issues, described below.

<p>
To update QPT, just run it and select Help > Software Update. QPT will refresh the application logic 
from the server and restart. If you cannot connect to the database or have other issues, quit and 
restart QPT. For troubleshooting hints and other update options, see
the second half of <a href="install.html"><i>Running QPT</i></a>.

<p>

As always, please direct questions and comments to <code>rnorris@gemini.edu</code> and cc: the QC groups if
appropriate.

<h2>New and Notable</h2>

<h3>[QPT-107] Integrated Plan Publishing</h3>
Publishing a queue plan is now fully automatic, and preview <i>should</i> now work on all platforms.
On OS X and Windows QPT uses native browser support. On *nix systems QPT will attempt to run <code>firefox</code>.
<p>
Plans are written to
<pre>staff@internal.gemini.edu:/export/web/docs/internal/html/science/</pre>
which is published to the web at
<pre><a href="http://internal.gemini.edu/science/">http://internal.gemini.edu/science/</a></pre>
and are placed in subdirectories in the form 
<pre>GNqueue/qpt-plans/2006/06/16/20060616.html</pre>
In
addition, GS plans are published to the home directory of <code>dataproc@chamaeleon</code> using the 
same subdirectory scheme. This is simply a backup in case connectivity to GN is lost.
<p>
Plans are staged in your temporary directory (usually <code>/tmp</code> on *nix systems), and are opened
directly from that location in preview mode. The files are not used after publishing is complete, and 
may be deleted freely (this will happen automatically at reboot).

<h3>[QPT-88, QPT-100] Support for Band 4 and Non-Queue Programs</h3>

QPT now shows Band 4 programs, as well as Non-Queue programs (which appear in Band 0). These types are not
visible by default but are available under the View menu. Note that these additional programs increase the 
memory overhead and query time for QPT; you may notice that database synchronization is slightly slower.

<h3>[QPT-101] New <code>info</code> Level Problem Markers</h3>

In addition to the previous <code>error</code> and <code>warning</code> marker levels, there is now a new
<code>info</code> level that includes the former "over-qualified" warning. Markers
at <code>info</code> level are simply hints for the QC and do not appear in the published plan.

<h3>[QPT-80, 96, 97, 127] Improved Instrument Config Support</h3>

QPT now includes NIRI filters in the Instruments view, and GMOS dispersers now work as
advertised. Instrument configuration information now appears in the Visits view and in the
published report.

<h3>[QPT-62] Candidate Observation Table is Sortable</h3>

You can now sort the table in the Candidate Observations view by clicking on any table header. Clicking
again reverses the sort order.

<h3>Other Minor and Self-Explanatory Changes</h3>

<ul>
<li>[QPT-135]	Skipped steps are now handled correctly.
<li>[QPT-134]	QPT now uses the Command key rather than Ctrl for text edit commands on Max OS X.
<li>[QPT-133]	Comment-only variants now appear in the plan, without the elevation plot and visit table.	 
<li>[QPT-129]	The window dimming effect for modal dialogs has been disabled in X11. It was ugly.
<li>[QPT-128]	All times are site-local based on the plan, rather than being based on the site where QPT is running.
<li>[QPT-125]	Published plans now include an "end of variant" line in each visit table.
<li>[QPT-124]	The expression <code>$variant.Comment</code> no longer shows up in the published plan.	 
<li>[QPT-123]	Empty variants (except those with a comment, see QPT-133) are not published.
<li>[QPT-120]	The observation time slot in the Properties view now correctly reports the end time.
<li>[QPT-116]	Sky background % bin is now shown in Visits table and published plan.
<li>[QPT-112]	Published plan now includes UT date in title.
<li>[QPT-111]	QPT now uses 24-hour time in all views and in the published report.
<li>[QPT-108]	Published report now uses relative URLs for image files.
<li>[QPT-105]	Properties view now shows min &bull; mean &bull; max for all time-varying values.
<li>[QPT-103]	Sky background % bin is now shown in Properties view. 
<li>[QPT-102]	Band 1, 2, 3, 4 filters now have accelerator keys.
<li>[QPT-99]	Steps are now labeled starting at 1 instead of 0.
<li>[QPT-95]	Visits view and published plan tables now include the columns from the old GN ASCII report.
<li>[QPT-93]	Visit step numbers are now indicated in some views to disambiguate markers.
<li>[QPT-91]	Observations with no target are no longer excluded, and are given an artificial target at RA = DEC = 0.
<li>[QPT-90]	Observations with no site constraints are no longer excluded, and are given an empty set of constraints.
<li>[QPT-83]	Properties view has been re-ordered slightly to require less scrolling in normal usage. 
</ul>
