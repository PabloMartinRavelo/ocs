<h1>QPT Troubleshooting Guide</h1>

This document outlines some common problems and their solutions. For more help,
please email <a href="mailto:rnorris@gemini.edu">Rob Norris</a>.

<h2>QPT won't start.</h2>

If QPT won't start, the easiest solution is to re-install:
<pre>
$ launcher -a:qpt -u
$ launcher -h:build.cl.gemini.edu -i:qpt -v
</pre>

<h2>I can't preview the nightly plan.</h2>

First, be sure that your web browser isn't minimized or living on another virtual
desktop; if your browser is configured to re-use widows, the plan may have opened
in a window that's not visible. On Windows and Mac OS X, QPT uses some built-in
functionality to open the plan
preview using your default web browser, but on Unix QPT will try to open the
plan using the <code>firefox</code> command. So if you don't have Firefox
installed, you're out of luck at the moment.
<p>
Note that the plan previews are written to the <code>/tmp</code> directory on
Unix, so in the worst case you can simply open the plan files manually. The
<code>file://</code> URL Will look something like this, with the proper date
values, obviously.
<pre>
file:///tmp/GSqueue/qpt-plans/2007/01/08/20070108.html
</pre>

<h2>Why isn't a particular program or observation showing up?</h2>

First, look at the filters you have selected under the View menu; it is possible
that what you are looking for has simply been hidden. If not, keep reading.
In order to show up in QPT, science programs must meet <b>all</b> of the following
criteria:
<ul>
<li>The program must <b>not</b> be marked as complete.
<li>The program must have a well-formed ID.
<li>The program must be of one of the following types:
	<code>Q</code>,
	<code>C</code>,
	<code>SV</code>,
	<code>DD</code>, or
	<code>DS</code>.
<li>The program must have a numeric queue band, even if it is not a type-<code>Q</code> program.
<li>The program must be long to the plan night's semester, <b>or</b> belong to a semester added
via the Add Semester command, <b>or</b> be a rollover program from one of the two
previous semesters.
</ul>
If the program is qualified as described above, each observation must meet the
following additional criteria:
<ul>
<li>The observation must have an obs class of <code>SCIENCE</code>, <code>PARTNER_CAL</code> or <code>PROGRAM_CAL</code>.
<li>The observation must have an obs status of <code>READY</code> or <code>ONGOING</code>.
<li>The observation must have at least one unexecuted sequence step.
</ul>

<h2>The visualizer looks weird; curves are jagged or labels are offset from visits.</h2>

Thare are a few display bugs that I haven't been able to isolate. If this happens,
try resizing your window. Normally this will reset all the cached shapes and fix
any drawing problems you might be seeing.
