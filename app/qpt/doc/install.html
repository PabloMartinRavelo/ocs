<h1>QPT Installation Guide</h1>

This document explains how to install QPT. Please glance over the
document before you begin, just so you know what to expect.
<p>
<span style="color:#A00000">If you are upgrading from a previous version of QPT,
see <a href="#update"><i>Updating QPT</i></a> below.</span>

<h2>Installing QPT</h2>

<h3>1. Verify that Java is installed.</h3>

First, you need to ensure that you have Java 1.6 installed. It comes with the OT distribution
for Linux and Windows (in <code>jre/bin</code>), and is available as a system update for the Mac. Verify that it is working
as follows:

<pre>
$ java -version
java version "1.6.0_15"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_15-b03-226)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 14.1-b02-92, mixed mode)
</pre>

If you're using the OT distribution, you may need to type the full path.
If you're using a Mac and have just installed Java 1.6, you may need to change
a symbolic link to get it working. Go to
<code>/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions</code> and change the
<code>CurrentJDK</code> link to point to <code>1.6</code>. You need to be root
or use <code>sudo</code> to do this.

<h3>2. Download the OSGi Launcher.</h3>

Next you need to download the OSGi application launcher, which you will use to install
and run the QPT. You should create a <code>.ocs</code> directory in you home directory
and put the file there:

<pre>
$ mkdir ~/.ocs
$ cd ~/.ocs
$ curl -O http://build.cl.gemini.edu:9999/runtime/launcher/launcher.jar
...
$ cd
</pre>
If you don't have <code>curl</code>, use your web browser or <code>wget</code>.
<p>
I recommend creating an alias to make it simpler to run the launcher. You should add this to
your standard list of shell aliases. Try it out on its own and you should see a pithy error
message.

<pre>
$ alias launcher='java -Xmx512m -jar ~/.ocs/launcher.jar'
$ launcher
Sorry, what application are we talking about? You need -a or -i, or both.
Let me help you. Try: java -jar launcher.jar -?
</pre>

This may seem like a lot of work, but you only have to do it once. It will allow
you to download and run any of the HLPG OSGi-based programs.


<h3><a name="step3"></a>3. Install and run QPT.</h3>

First, use the launcher to install the application definition.

<pre>
$ launcher -h:build.cl.gemini.edu -i:qpt -v
</pre>

Now we can run QPT. The first time you run it, it will download all its components
from <code>build.cl.gemini.edu</code>, so it may take a little while to get going the first
time, especially in the north.

<pre>
$ launcher -a:qpt

Welcome to Oscar.
=================

...
</pre>

<p>

There is also a quiet mode that suppresses console output (actually it just redirects
it to some files under <code>~/.ocs</code>.
<pre>
$ launcher -a:qpt -n &
</pre>

<h2><a name="update"></a>Updating QPT</h2>

To update QPT, just run it and select Help > Update Software. QPT will refresh the
application logic from the server and restart.
If this process fails for some reason, you can kill the process and try to restart
QPT. If it won't start up, you can just re-install
(see below).

<h2>Updating QPT while Preserving the Previous Version</h2>
If you wish to update QPT and retain your previous version just in case, you may simply
rename the application cache directory under <code>~/ocs/<i>hostname</i>/</code>. Be sure
QPT is not running.
<pre>
$ cd ~/.ocs
$ cd <i>hostname</i>
$ ls
qpt
$ mv qpt qpt-1.0.0
</pre>
You may then run this older version by specifying the new name:
<pre>
$ launcher -a:qpt-1.0.0
</pre>
To install the new version, go to <a href="#step3">step 3<a> of the installation instructions above.


<h2>Re-Installing QPT</h2>

If your QPT stops functioning for some reason (this can happen due to a failed software update,
for instance), you can easily reinstall it. Simply type
<pre>
launcher -a:qpt -u
</pre>
and then jump to <a href="#step3">step 3<a> of the installation instructions above.
