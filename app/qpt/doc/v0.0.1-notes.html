<h1>QPT 0.0.1 Release Notes</h1>

<p>
QPT 0.0.1 tracks the 2014A.1.1.1 OCS release.  Release notes for the previous
release are available <a href="v1.0.30-notes.html">here</a>.  Please excuse
the strange change in version numbers, this will be addressed in a future
release.

<p>The QPT documentation index is available <a href="index.html">here</a>.

<h2>New and Notable</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Installation of the QPT is no longer done via the "launcher".  Obtain the
installer for your platform and install it directly as you would do with
the OT.

</ul>
